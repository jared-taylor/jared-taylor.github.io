## Inventing the wheel

The number one idea I associate with Software Development is writing code. I think most software developers' success depends on their ability to envision a task broken down into the pieces that will be required to make it work and come up with an efficient way to create code that will accomplish the task efficiently. The solution should work efficiently but should ideally also be created efficiently, and that is where design patterns come in. Design patterns can be thought of as pre-established ways of accomplishing tasks that can be reused many times in a project, which cuts down on the time and amount of code required to make a useful program. It boils down to the fact that once we find the best way to solve a problem, we can use the experience and knowledge to avoid re-inventing the proverbial wheel and apply a verifiably good solution to future problems of a similar nature. It is safe to say that all software developers implement design patterns, though not always in a premeditated or conscious way. As I see it, any use of a method is a design pattern in a very high-level way. Writing a method is a basic way of creating a tool that can be used multiple times in a program to repeatedly accomplish a task, which is the essence of a design pattern. It is probably one of the first things a fledgling software developer will do, but the big leap is to identify when a boxed solution can be reused to accomplish a similar or more complex task by reusing  an existing tool. 

Here is a simple example to show how this could be implemented:
