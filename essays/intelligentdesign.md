## Designing a design pattern

The number one idea I associate with Software Development is writing code. I think most software developers' success depends on their ability to envision a task broken down into the pieces that will be required to make it work and come up with an efficient way to create code that will accomplish the task efficiently. The solution should work efficiently but should ideally also be created efficiently, and that is where design patterns come in. Design patterns can be thought of as pre-established ways of accomplishing tasks that can be reused many times in a project, which cuts down on the time and amount of code required to make a useful program. It is safe to say that all software developers implement design patterns, though not always in a premeditated or conscious way.
