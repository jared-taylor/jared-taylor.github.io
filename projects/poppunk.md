*this is my precious baby*

My most recent recording project started as a simple 18-second recording of some music for a friend to use as an intro for his YouTube channel. I liked what I came up with so much that I decided to make a whole song out of it. I recorded the bass & guitar parts, but since I don't have a drumset or a good setup to record one, I decided to look into options for creating my own with samples.

I asked around with some other friends who create music, and one of them pointed me to Soundtrap, a service run by Spotify, that offers simple tools to create an impressive variety of beats and synth instruments. It is not as powerful as some of the expensive options I have used in the past, but it is extremely capable for a free tool. I dropped in my recording and started arranging various drums. While the intention is for musicians to be able to do all the recording and arranging in their application, Soundtrap allows the export of individual tracks, so I set up a separate track for each drum in a standard kit so I can later export these and then drop them into the application I used for the original recording so I can mix and master each track and make it sound (hopefully) just like real drums.

It is still a work in progress, and will need a vocal recording before I am ready to share it, but I am very excited about this project and about a new, free tool that I am looking forward to exploring. When it is ready, I will update this project page with some links to the finished product.
